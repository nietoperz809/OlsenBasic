# Basicv2 Shell in a JFrame

This is a fork of Egon's CBM-BASIC running in a windowed shell.

You can edit programs using a line editor similar to the original C64, list them, run them, save and load

The original BASIC-System can be found here: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2

I only created the com.sixtyfour.basicshell package. :)
